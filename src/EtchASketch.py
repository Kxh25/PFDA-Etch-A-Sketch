    Etch-A-Sketch.
    
    This function ties all the class functions together to create the screen. The screen
    should include a canvas, a drawing cursor that can only move within
    the canvas bounds, a directional knob/button, a size button, a color button,
    a speed modifier, a save button, and an ESC button.
