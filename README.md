# Digital Etch-A-Sketch
## https://github.com/Kxh25/PFDA-Etch-A-Sketch.git

For my final project, I have decided to create a virtual etch-a-sketch. The program would ba like a basic drawing app with the controls
of an etch-a-sketch. The project uses the turtle drawing library to allow for the program to draw lines and pictures.The project has several 
buttons that will affect your drawing cursor. The program has a **draw** button that will draw a line 20 pixels in the direction the turtle 
cursor is facing. A second **direction** button will change the direction the turtle is facing. There are three other buttons, **color**,
**size**, and **speed**, that will alter the color of the cursor and lines you draw, the size of the lines, and the speed at which the cursor
moves. There is also a **clear** button that will clear the screen of any lines drawn and return the turtle cursor the its original position.
And finally, there is a save button that will remove the cursor and save your drawing onto your computer.

The repository SRC folder contains many different program files: 
  - A *EtchASketch_attempt1.py* attempt at the program using the **pygame** library.
  - A *test.py* program used to test out creating buttons
  - A *sketch.py* program used to test out drawing lines using the terminal. (Came from a video tutorial)
  - A *Etch-A-Sketch_Final.py* program that contains the final code using the **turtle** library.
The repository also contains extra files of renamed programs, or scrapped files that are not in use.

I chose to do an etch-a-sketch for my final because programming is not m strong suit. I can confidently say this because I have taken other
programming classes, some of which I failed, and most I barely passed without recieving credit hours. I wanted to do something that I believe
was easy enough, but provided enough of a challenge to get through.

I was also doing this project in the middle of three other class projects, so while I have sucessfully made the etch-a-sketch, there are many
things I would like to improve. For example, I would like to improve the etch-a-sketch design-wise. The program is at is most basic level 
when it comes to design of the screen and button, and I would like to enhance the graphics even by just a little bit. In addition, I would 
like to have simplified my code better. No matter how hard I tried, I could not understand how to fit my code into classes. I would also
have liked to start with using python turtle much earlier, as I started the project using pygame (a library not as fit for a drawing program).

But I am glad to say that I'm proud of how this project turned out. I have learned a lot more from this class than any of my previous courses,
to the point where I could create my own program.
