# Final Project: Digital Etch A Sketch
##Etch A Sketch

Create a digital etch a sketch that allows the user to draw lines on a screen using two buttons/knobs at the bottom of the screen as their advantage.
The user should be able to change the color and size of their brush while they are drawing, and then save their work as a png file onto their computer.

The project lists many features. One of the main features includes the drawing aspect. The user will be able to draw a continuous line by either pressing and holding a button, or by draging down a knob, 
which should affect the line speed. There is a second knob/button that controls the direction the line will move towards (up, down, left, right). The pencil will only move in four directions liek a normal etch-a-sketch.

Another feature the etch-a-sketch will have is the ability to change the size and color of the brush, and speed at which the brush moves. The user can achieve this by pressing three different buttons on the side
of the etch-a-sketch. This will be the most difficult feature to program, as clicking on the buttons should move to the next object within a list of objects rather than having a dropdown option. In addition,
each item in each list should have some effect on the main brush.

The final feature would be a save feature that would save your final drawing onto your computer as a png file. This could be implemented as a small button on the top right of the etch-a-sketch, which opens
your computer's file explore.

With a program like this, I would need to research a lot more pygame and turtle methods to implement into the code. In addition, I will also need to research more about classes and how to
effectively create them.

My ideal outcome is that the prograam with display a screen designed as an etch-a-sketch with two knobs at the bottom, 3 brush adjuster buttons on the side, and a white screen in the center that
displays the etch drawing the user creates in real time. I believe that the pencil knobs will be a difficult task, so if I cannot create a knob, I will instead use buttons for my outcome. 

Since I have 4 weeks to make the code work, I will have to set milestones for each week:
  For week 1: I would like to have the base design of an etch-a-sketch tablet to show on the display window.
  For week 2: I would have the draw feature implemented on the white canvas potion of the etch-a-sketch. In addition, I want to have prototype knobs/buttons implemented to
              control the brush movement and direction in real time.
  For week 3: I want to make rough buttons on the side of the etch-e-sketch that will change the brush color, size, and speed. This may be difficult, so this goal may extend
              to week 4.
  For week 4: I want to have the final designs of the buttons implemented onto the screen. I also want to add a save image feature that saves your final image to your computer.
